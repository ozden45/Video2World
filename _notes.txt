Given your structure, this is already fairly professional 👍 — it looks like a clean Python package with:

* `src/v2w/` → main library code
* `tests/` → separated test hierarchy
* `configs/` → configuration
* `experiments/` → research runs
* `notebooks/` → exploration

Now for a **video → 3D points converter**, the correct location depends on its role.

# 🎯 Short Answer

For a professional, scalable structure:

> ✅ Put the core converter logic inside:

```
src/v2w/inference/
```

or, if it's geometric reconstruction–focused:

```
src/v2w/geometry/
```

---

# 🧠 How to Decide

## 1️⃣ If it is a Pipeline / Runtime Component

(e.g., takes video → runs model → outputs point cloud)

Put it in:

```
src/v2w/inference/video_to_points.py
```

Because:

* It’s a runtime operation
* It connects model + geometry + dataset
* It’s not a pure math utility

This is the most common professional choice.

---

## 2️⃣ If It’s Pure Reconstruction Logic

(e.g., triangulation, structure-from-motion math)

Put it in:

```
src/v2w/geometry/reconstruction.py
```

Because:

* It belongs to geometric algorithms
* It should be model-agnostic

---

## 3️⃣ If It’s a Trainable Model (end-to-end network)

Then:

```
src/v2w/models/video_to_points_model.py
```

But this is only if it's literally a neural network class.

# 🏗 Recommended Professional Layout

For your case, I’d structure it like this:

```
src/v2w/
    inference/
        video_to_points.py      ← pipeline orchestration
    geometry/
        triangulation.py
        sfm.py
        pointcloud.py
```

Where:

* `video_to_points.py` → orchestrates:

  * video loading
  * feature extraction
  * depth estimation / pose estimation
  * triangulation
  * returns point cloud

* `geometry/` → contains math-only modules

---

# 🧪 Tests

Mirror it in:

```
tests/unit/inference/test_video_to_points.py
tests/unit/geometry/test_triangulation.py
```

---

# 🚫 Where NOT to Put It

❌ Not in `utils/`
That folder should only contain generic helpers (logging, io, small tools).

❌ Not in `datasets/`
That’s for data loaders only.

❌ Not in `experiments/`
That’s for scripts and experiment configs.

---

# 🏆 Professional Rule of Thumb

> **Pipelines go in `inference/`**
> **Math goes in `geometry/`**
> **Neural networks go in `models/`**

If you describe your converter (class-based? CLI tool? model-based? SfM?), I can suggest an exact file + class structure.
